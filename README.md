# Leetcode-and-Hackerrank

A place where I put solutions to all the Leetcode and Hackerrank problems that I solve

All solutions will be either in Python, Java or C or a combination of the three

Most of the problems have a python solution, with some of the data strcuture related questions like Linked Lists and Binary Search Trees, implemented in C/Java

Problems that I have solved:
