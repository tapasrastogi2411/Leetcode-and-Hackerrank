# Leetcode Problem number 704: Binary Search - Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

 # You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
